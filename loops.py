# Loops - allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly. They help automate repetitive tasks & mkae programs more effecient

# ForLoop - used to iterate over a sequence such as a lost, tuple, string or range, and perform an action for each item in the sequence.

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "naartjie", "cherry"]

#for fruit in fruits:
    #print(fruit)
    

#numbers = [1, 2, 6, 9]

#for number in numbers:
    #print(number)
    

# WhileLoops

#  Using a while loop to count from 1 to 5.
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1 # Increases the count by 1 each time
